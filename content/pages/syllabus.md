Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 1 session / week, 2 hours / session

This course examines the issues, principles, and challenges toward building machines that cooperate with humans and with other machines. Philosophical, scientific, and theoretical insights into this subject will be covered, as well as how these ideas are manifest in both natural and artificial systems (e.g. software agents and robots). Course grade will be based on weekly student assignments and presentations, participation in lively class discussion, and a final term project.
