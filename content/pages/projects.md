This section displays one of the exemplary projects from the semester, by Andrea Lockerd and Guy Hoffman.Â  All of the work is courtesy of the two students, and used with permission.

### Summary

In this project we would like to tackle the problems of joint reference and joint intention in a human-robot collaboration task. Our work is motivated by the desire to teach a robot (Leo) a task from beginning to end and then have him act in a robust way to execute this task in collaboration with a human teammate. In order to do so, both the problems of joint reference and of joint intention need to be solved.
